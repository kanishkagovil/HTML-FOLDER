    <b>Backtracking</b><br>
    <pre>Backtracking is a form of recusrion.
        
        The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
      must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new
      set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
      you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final
      state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal
      state; if you didn't, it isn't.

      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
      good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all
      good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning
      with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep
      this up until you get to a leaf. Suppose you get to a bad leaf.

      You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
      most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options.
      If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
      another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options
      left, there are no good leaves to be found.

      This needs an example.
      </pre>
      <img src="./image.gif"><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>
      </ol><br>
      <pre>
        In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model
        of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data
        structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to
        tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data
        structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
  
      </pre><br>
      <b>The backtracking algorithm.</b><br>
      <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n) { 
            if n is a leaf node { 
              if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
              else return false 
            } else { 
              for each child c of n { 
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
               } 
               return false 
              } 
            }


            Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
            essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means
            node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a
            path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
            solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
      </pre>
      <b>How does this work?</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li><br>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li><br>
      </ul>
      <pre>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path
        to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
        solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code,
        this is done by the lines

        if n is a leaf node { 
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
             else return false

        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand
        it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
      </pre><br>
      <b>
        <ul>
            <li>To Search a Tree:</li>
        </ul>
      </b><br>
        <ol>
            <li> If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li><br>
            <li> Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
                node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <b>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</b><br>
        <pre>
            Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
            algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your
            recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.

            boolean solve(Node n) { 
                put node n on the stack;
                 while the stack is not empty { 
                  if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { 
                    if it is a goal node, return true 
                    else pop it off the stack 
                  } 
                  else {
                     if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                      push the next untried child onto the stack
                       else pop the node off the stack 
                      } 
                      return false
                     }
            Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
            are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these
            are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at
            all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the
            stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their
             descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack
            empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
            problem.

            When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
            form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.

            Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path
            information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive
            calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node
            at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or
            storing it in an array.

            Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print
            (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
           
           
            
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                  if the leaf is a goal node {
                    print n
                     return true
                    }
                     else return false
                    } else { 
                     for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds {
                          print n
                           return true
                          } 
                         } return false
                        } 
                       }
      
        </pre><br>
        <b>Keeping backtracking simple</b><br>
        <pre>
            To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in
            methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a
            leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong> (or you could even call
            it <strong>isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the ugly
            details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.


            Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each
            node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already
            (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look
            simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n.</strong> In reality,
            it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and
            there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a
            node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each
            child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made
            a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of
            which ones you've already examined?

            The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
            have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is,
            when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
            you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there
            are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a
            simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.

            For example, you might be able to number the
            <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order.
            Then, if you have just tried <strong>child k,</strong> you know that you
            have already tried children 1 through <strong>k-1</strong>, and you have
            not yet tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through
            <strong>n.</strong> Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four
            colors, you can always try
            <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child
            yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a
            maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right
            <strong>(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</strong> 

            It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.
            <strong>In the chess game example,</strong> you might number your pieces
            (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but
            in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be
            ordered.

        <b>Example: Tree Search</b><br>
        <pre>
            A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is
            designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one,
            or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are
            referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
            reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no
            cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a
            binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node,
            and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we
            repeat here) shows a binary tree.

            Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:

            public class BinaryTree { 
                BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
                BinaryTree rightChild = null; 
                boolean isGoalNode = false; 
                String name;

            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { 
                this.name = name;
                leftChild = left;
                rightChild = right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                    }
                    }
        </pre><br>
        <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>
            <li> See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node
                is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null and is
                not a goal node, says to</li><br>
            <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
            <li> Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable</li>
        </ol><br>
        <b>What are the children?</b><br>
        <pre>
          One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at
          each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous
          choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as
          far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions.
          In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children
          immediately, without recursion.

          To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for
          the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored.

          There are two ways to do this:
          <ul>
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run
              out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an
              adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you
              have successfully colored the map.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </pre><br>
        <b>boolean mapIsOK()</b><br>
        <p> Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is
          colored correctly.</p><br>
        <b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b><br>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent
          node already colored with the given color.</p><br>
        <p> Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good.
          However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p><br>

            <b>Debugging techniques</b><br>
            <pre>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it.
              Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting
              print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
              print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are
              especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</pre>

          The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In
          solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
          case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't
          so easy. 

          Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a
          recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The
          backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or
          it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.

          Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new
          board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to
          find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only
          find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly
          desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br />
          Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must
          analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would
          work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to
          program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid
          approach.

          Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a
          unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble,
          we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is
          possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from
          that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique.
          There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble,
          but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
        </pre><br>
        <b> Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check,
          in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one
          moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method
          canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is
          possible from the given position:</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
            <li>
              If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or
              jump to the right;
            </li>
            <li>
              If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or
              jump to the left.
            </li>
          </ul><br>
          <p>
            We write another method
            <strong>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will
            take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as
            its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by
            changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are
            more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is
            "applicative" rather than "mutative." <br />
            Along with <strong>canMove and makeMove,</strong> we are using methods
            <strong>puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong> with meanings that should be
            obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be
            written as follows:
          </p><br>
          <pre>
            boolean solvable(int[] board) {
              if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 
              return true; 
              } 
              for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) { 
              if (canMove(board, position)) { 
              int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
              if (solvable(newBoard)) { 
              printBoard(newBoard); 
              return true; 
              } 
              } 
              } 
              return false; 
              }</pre
            >
          </pre><br>
          <p>
            Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and
            printBoard with meanings that should be obvious. <br /><br />
            Here is some output from the program:
      
          </p><br>
          <ol start="16" reversed>
              <li><strong>WHITE  WHITE  WHITE  _______ BLACK   BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE  WHITE  WHITE  _______  BLACK  BLACK BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp;WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; _______ &nbsp;   BLACK &nbsp; BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; BLACK </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; _______ </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>WHITE &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp;_______ &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>_______ &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>BLACK &nbsp;_______ &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>BLACK &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>BLACK &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>BLACK &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp;_______ &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
              <li><strong>BLACK &nbsp;BLACK &nbsp; _______ &nbsp; BLACK &nbsp;WHITE &nbsp; WHITE &nbsp; WHITE </strong></li>
         </ol>
         <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on 
          the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added 
          line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. 
          Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; 
          it is up to you, the programmer,
           to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order</p>
